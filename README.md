# Strong-Prime-Generator
Strong Prime Generator (Cryptography Project)

## Strong Prime Generator
`spg.py` contains algorithm for strong prime generation `RSA.generateStrongPrime` and Miller-Rabin algorithm `RSA.MR` for primality checking.

## RSA
`rsa.py` contains proof of concept for generating RSA keys using `spg.py`. Create `RSA` object and call `getPrimes` to get the key.
